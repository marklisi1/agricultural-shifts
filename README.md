[PCA/K-means clustering and Gaussian processes to better understand the future of agriculture!](Agricultural-Shift-Prediction.pdf)

As the consequences of climate change become more frequent and severe, we are
forced to consider the effects of droughts, floods, and storms on one of the worldâ€™s
most foundational industries - agriculture. In this study, we aim to better understand
the potential effects of our shifting climate on agriculture using K-means clustering
and Gaussian processes. We use PCA and K-means clustering to better understand
the relationship between specific crops, and apply a Gaussian process model to
historical records of chemical soil composition in and around Kansas to make
projections about future shifts.

This repository also contains a neural network capable of predicting which crops are most likely to be grown in specific conditions.
The clear extension of this is to combine the environmental forecasting generated by Gaussian process models with the predictions
generated by the neural network to assess what crops will be most viable in the future.
